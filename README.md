In this assignment I built a Java page utilizing bootstrap to structure the Nav, forms, table, buttons and images.
For body class I used bd-secondary to initialize a gray background, for the navigations I used several elements such as navbar-toggler, fixed top and collapse to fix it to the top as well as responsive on any screen size.

I wrapped the registration form inside of a container and used col-md-6 to position the first and last names side by side. I used bootstrap script at the bottom of my page and invalid-feedback to ensure feedback is required. I used btn-success to color the button green.

For my table I used table-responsive to make ensure the it was scrollable on smaller screens I also ensured it was striped and darkened when hovered over.

I used img-fluid to ensure my images scaled properly and used rounded-circle to make the second image circular. Finally I created two buttons one that remains on any screen size and one that disappears using the btn-primary, d-none and d-md-inline-block.
